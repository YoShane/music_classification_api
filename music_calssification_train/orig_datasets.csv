 我並不完美 也並不特別
而祢卻是為我捨棄生命的主
我時常軟弱 有時會迷惑
但祢是道路真理和生命


主祢要往哪裡走 我就跟祢走
領我走到世界盡頭 一生不再回頭
讓世界聽到我們敬拜 我們的禱告
讓復興從我們開始 將主愛帶到人群中


縱然有許多的問題 我也不放棄
祢大能賜給我勇氣 我會勇敢走出去"

讚嘆是 對祢的回應
       


   常常的喜樂
                          
   凡事要謝恩
                           
   不住的禱告
                          
   大聲來宣告
                           


我要唱 可以再大聲一點
      
我拍手 震碎仇敵下顎
     
我跳躍 用盡所有的力氣
      
我宣告 應許成就
   


要憑信心 不是憑感覺
      
現在要選擇來 喜樂讚美
         
要憑信心 不是憑感覺
      
現在要選擇來 喜樂讚美

不是屬血氣的
是在神面前得能力
攻破各樣的詭計

不是倚靠自己
是在神面前有信心
攻破仇敵的營地

穿上神所賜的全副軍裝
在患難的日子抵擋仇敵

穿上神所賜的全副軍裝
成就了一切還能靠主站立
成就了一切
還能靠主站立勝利

要準備好
用真理做腰帶
用公義做護胸的盔甲
把平安的福音當作鞋子穿在腳上
用信心作盾牌
用救恩作頭盔
拿著聖靈的寶劍
不斷地儆醒禱告"
